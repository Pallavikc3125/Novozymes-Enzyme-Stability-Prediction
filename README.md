# Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction


* Novozymes finds enzymes in nature and optimizes them for use in industry. The goal of this project is to predict the thermostability (melting point) after single-point amino acid mutation and deletion.
* Performed TF-IDF to convert protein sequence into vectors using SKlearn. Built Linear Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost model for the prediction of thermostability(tm).
* Used RandomizedSearchCV, Hyperparameter tuning to increase the accuracy. Accuracy achieved is 82%. Deployed the model using Streamlit.
